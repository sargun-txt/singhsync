-  **Ultra-Fast Transfer Mode** — Experience blazing-fast transfer speeds that match or even beat AirDrop. We utilize optimized network protocols to ensure you never have to wait for large file transfers again.The only downside is that , its works by removing the encryption of the transfer so its highly recommended to use on Private or Home Networks.
