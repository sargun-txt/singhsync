/**
 * Centralises all notification creation and display logic for the ClipSync application.
 *
 * Two distinct notification channels are managed here to separate concerns by importance level:
 *
 *  - [CHANNEL_CLIPBOARD]: High-importance channel used for real-time clipboard and OTP events.
 *    Notifications on this channel appear as floating heads-up banners so the user immediately
 *    sees an incoming OTP or synced clipboard entry without pulling down the shade.
 *
 *  - [CHANNEL_SERVICE]: Low-importance channel used exclusively by the persistent foreground
 *    service. Low importance suppresses sound and vibration, keeping the always-on service
 *    notification unobtrusive while still satisfying Android's foreground-service requirement.
 *
 * Both channels are registered with the OS as soon as a [NotificationHelper] instance is
 * constructed, guaranteeing they exist before any notification is posted. Android silently
 * ignores duplicate channel registrations, so constructing multiple instances is safe.
 *
 * @param context The application context used to obtain the [NotificationManager] and build intents.
