/**
 * ClipSyncApp is the custom [Application] subclass that serves as the process-wide entry
 * point for the Android app. The Android runtime instantiates this class exactly once,
 * before any Activity, Service, or BroadcastReceiver is created, making it the canonical
 * place for initialisation work that must complete before any component runs.
 *
 * This class performs three startup tasks:
 *
 * 1. **Hybrid-only Firebase initialization** — FirebaseInitProvider is removed from the
 *    manifest. The Canada/default app is configured manually from google-services.json and
 *    retains FCM/Crashlytics. US Auth/Firestore retain the named CrossivaUS/CrossivaIN apps, initialized
 *    only when the corresponding region is selected. Local-only startup initializes neither app.
 *
 * 2. **Anonymous authentication** — Firestore security rules require every incoming request
 *    to carry a valid Firebase Auth token. Because ClipSync has no user accounts, it
 *    obtains a token silently via Firebase Anonymous Auth. The user is never shown a
 *    sign-in prompt. The auth state persists across restarts, so the network round-trip
 *    only occurs once per app installation.
 *
 * 3. **Device ID seeding** — [DeviceManager.getDeviceId] generates and stores a stable UUID
 *    for this device on the very first launch. Calling it here guarantees the ID exists
 *    and is cached in SharedPreferences before any other component needs it.
 *
 * Declare this class in `AndroidManifest.xml` with `android:name=".ClipSyncApp"`.

     * simply degrade gracefully until the next opportunity to retry.
