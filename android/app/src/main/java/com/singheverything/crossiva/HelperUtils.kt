/**
 * HelperUtils is a stateless singleton that provides shared utility functions used across
 * multiple layers of the ClipSync application.
 *
 * Its primary responsibility is **OTP detection**: given an arbitrary string — clipboard
 * content, a notification body, or any short text — it can determine whether that string
 * looks like a one-time password message and, if so, extract the raw code from it.
 *
 * Detection is intentionally conservative. The logic is tuned to produce very few false
 * positives on ordinary prose while reliably catching the three OTP formats most commonly
 * seen in bank SMS messages, app verification flows, and authentication emails:
 *
 *   1. A plain sequence of 4–8 digits            — e.g. `"983201"` or `"1234"`
 *   2. A six-digit code split by a dash or space  — e.g. `"123-456"` or `"123 456"`
 *   3. An alphanumeric code with an optional dash — e.g. `"AB-12345"` or `"G123456"`

    /**
     * Pre-compiled regular expression used to locate OTP codes within arbitrary text.
     *
     * The pattern is anchored with `\b` (word boundary) on both sides of each alternative
     * to prevent partial matches inside longer numbers such as phone numbers or timestamps.
     * It consists of three alternating groups:
     *
     *   - **Group 1** `\b(\d{4,8})\b`
     *     A standalone run of 4 to 8 digits. Covers the vast majority of numeric OTPs
     *     used by banking apps, two-factor auth services, and delivery notifications.
     *
     *   - **Group 2** `\b(\d{3}[-\s]\d{3})\b`
     *     Two 3-digit groups separated by a single hyphen or whitespace character.
     *     This matches the split format used by Google, Apple, and many banking apps
     *     (e.g. `"123-456"` or `"123 456"`).
     *
     *   - **Group 3** `\b([A-Za-z]{1,4}-?\d{3,8})\b`
     *     An alphanumeric code starting with 1–4 letters, an optional hyphen, then 3–8
     *     digits (e.g. Google's `"G-XXXXXX"` style or carrier codes like `"AA123456"`).
     *
     * Compiling once as a static field avoids the overhead of regex compilation on every
     * clipboard-change event, which can fire at high frequency.
